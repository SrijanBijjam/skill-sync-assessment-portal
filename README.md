## Main Features

### Resume Parsing

- **Upload**: Users can upload their resume in PDF format.
- **Parsing**: The app uses a local PDF parser (PDF.js) to extract:
  - Full text
  - Skills
  - Experience
  - Projects
  - Education
  - Certifications
  - Personal information (name, email, phone, etc.)
- **Section Extraction**: The parser uses regex and heading detection to accurately extract relevant sections from various resume formats.

### AI-Summarized Profile Summary

- After parsing, the app uses OpenAI's GPT-4o nano model to generate a concise, professional summary of the candidate's background.
- The summary highlights key skills, experience, and qualifications, and is tailored to be suitable for use in job applications or LinkedIn profiles.

### AI-Powered Job Matching

- **Job Description**: The app includes a sample job description (configurable in the code).
- **Matching Algorithm**: When the user proceeds, the app sends both the candidate profile and the job description to OpenAI.
- **AI Analysis**: The AI:
  - Extracts 4-6 key skills/competencies from the job description
  - Scores the candidate (0-100) for each skill based on their resume/profile
  - Provides an overall match percentage
  - Lists strengths, gaps, and personalized recommendations
  - Generates a summary paragraph explaining the match
- **Scoring**: The numbers and percentages are calculated by the AI model, which analyzes the overlap between the candidate's skills/experience and the job requirements. The scores are not randomâ€”they are based on the actual content of the resume and job description.

### Cache Clearing and Data Removal

- **Remove Resume**: Pressing 'Remove' in the Upload Your Resume section clears all form fields and resets the profile data. This is why it takes you back to the home page or the initial upload state.
- **Clear Cache Page**: There is a dedicated page to clear all stored data (localStorage), which is useful for troubleshooting or starting fresh.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: Why does pressing 'Remove' in the Upload Resume section clear all my data?**  
A: This is by design. Pressing 'Remove' clears all form fields and profile data, resetting the app to its initial state so you can start fresh.

**Q: What file formats are supported for resume upload?**  
A: Currently, only PDF files are supported.

**Q: How are the job match scores and percentages calculated?**  
A: The AI analyzes your profile and the job description, extracts key skills from the job requirements, and scores your profile for each skill (0-100). The overall match score is based on how well your skills and experience align with the job.

**Q: Can I use my own job description?**  
A: Yes, you can modify `/src/config/jobDescription.ts` to use your own job description for matching.

**Q: What if the resume parser misses some information?**  
A: You can manually edit your skills, experience, and personal info after parsing.

**Q: How do I clear all my data?**  
A: Use the "Clear Cache" page or the "Remove" button in the upload step.
